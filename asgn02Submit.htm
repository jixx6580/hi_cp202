  <p><strong>Title:</strong> CS GO (stands for Computer Sciences Go)
  </p>

  <p><strong>Mission:</strong></p>

  <p>“Giving a hand to the tomorrow’s golden coders”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p>

  <p>Our target audiences are mainly the students studying or interested in computer science courses at laurier. Laurier’s computer science faculty is relatively smaller than the other faculties in laurier. Many students enrolled into the computer sciences courses actually have their majors in different field of study such as business. There are many occasions when students find themselves stuck while working their way through assignments or coding for practices. There are websites such as “Stack Overflow” which students can look for help from other people. However, many students have difficult time understanding the answer given by the professionals using experts’ terms and higher-level of codes they haven’t learned yet. CS GO resolves the issue by creating the place where laurier students can assist each other to solve their computer science related questions. By providing a in-depth look at each course, our website will help current Computer science students connect with other students and share their experiences and knowledge with their peers.</p>

  <p><strong>Content:</strong></p>

  <p>CS GO will have separate sections for all computer science courses in laurier. Within each sections, students who are enrolled in the course can post their codes for problems and assistance or simply ask for general questions. Other students who know about the contents or have already taken the course before can reply to the question. Also, each section for courses will have brief explanation of what the course is about for the non-computer science students interested in enrolling in the class in near future. Therefore, the intended contents of CS GO mainly come from the students of Laurier. Students can share their work, ask questions, answer questions and learn about different courses offered in this faculty. Rather than a professional or a professor tutoring students about the course or materials; students have the opportunity to learn from current students or past students. This helps makes the learning curve easier and putting the knowledge into words that new students can easily understand.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Requirements Gathering Techniques:</strong></p>

  <p>CS GO’s contents heavily rely on students’ posts and other students who are willing to respond to questions. It is hard to expect many students to post their questions and reply at first. Therefore, we will start gathering the information from professors and upper year students in early stage. This way we can fill CS GO with the most basic information students need before the course starts such as proper requirements and information that students want to know. This can also enhance our reputation as a reliable website to learn about the program. As the number of the users increase, we will be receiving most of the content from students than professors.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Requirements Gathering First Draft:</strong></p>

  <p>We can start gathering information from students and what they need and deem helpful for them. We can go to places where computer science students go or look online. We can get feedback from surveys that we post on Laurier Computer Science Online pages such as Facebook. We can also collect feedback and advice in person from Computer Science students by spreading our name through word-of-mouth. Our main source of word-of-mouth would be professors, if we can prove that CS GO is a reliable site to recommend to students, professors will be inclined to recommend it to students that need help or extra practice.
