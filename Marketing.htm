<h2>About Marketing:</h2>
<p>Marketing is an important field for any business. Itâ€™s how you communicate your value to your customers and persuade potential customers to buy your product. Marketers can help develop new products, increase sales of current products or expand your market. There are multiple career paths in the world of marketing. Ranging from publicity jobs to developing marketing plans for new launches.</p>
<h2>Marketing Career Paths:</h2>
<h3>Services Marketer</h3>
<p>Services marketing is a whole different field from product marketing. In a product market, the product is made, delivered, used at different times. In a service, the production, delivery and usage are done at the same time. This makes it challenging for marketers to keep the product consistent because it has multiple varying factors. </p>
<h3>B2B Sales and Marketing Representative</h3>
<p>In a Business to business environment, you are selling to another company rather than a consumer. Whether is a large supplier or a large customer, business marketing is an important segment in more businesses. Jobs in this field typically are commission based on the amount and/or value of sales completed. </p>
<h3>Global Product Marketer</h3>
<p>Do you like travel and learning about different cultures? Then global marketing may be a good fit for you. Global marketing is the focus of bringing an existing product in your host nation to an international scale. It takes into consideration the costs, the different societal norms, different laws and other hurdles of bringing a product to another country. Global marketing can also be done within 1 country. A vast country like Canada has different norms from province to province within its own borders. </p>
