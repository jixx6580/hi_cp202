<h1>Changes</h1>
<p>This page contains the information of changes made from the original conceptual design. </p>
<h2>Content Changes</h2>
<p>Originally, our page was named "CSGO" which stands for Computer Science Go with contents to help computer science students at Laurier University.
  We have decided to change the page content to business as both designers, Tom and Himanshu, are third year business students with suffiencient knowledges of it.
  Therefore, we have changed our website to "BU Career". Our webpage now provides general information of each fields of businesses and their career paths. </p>
<h2>Layout & List Changes</h2>
<p>Not many changes are made to the layout of the website. "BU Career" stays with its simple design and layout. Navigation bar is placed on the top of the webpage.
  All page lists have changed as the content is now about business. The website now includes pages for finance, accounting, marketing, HR, and international business.
  Also, we have decided to include mission statement and website description to the home page instead of creating a separate page for it.</p>
